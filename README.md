# ViewPager
Android application to Swipe views provide lateral navigation between sibling screens such as tabs with a horizontal finger gesture (a pattern sometimes known as horizontal paging) using Kotlin Programming Language.

[ViewPager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/ViewPager.html) is most often used in conjunction with Fragment, which is a convenient way to supply and manage the lifecycle of each page. There are standard adapters implemented for using fragments with the ViewPager, which cover the most common use cases. These are FragmentPagerAdapter and FragmentStatePagerAdapter; each of these classes have simple code showing how to build a full user interface with them.

[TabLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/TabLayout.html) provides a horizontal layout to display tabs. Population of the tabs to display is done through TabLayout.Tab instances. You create tabs via newTab(). From there you can change the tab's label or icon via setText(int) and setIcon(int) respectively. To display the tab, you need to add it to the layout via one of the addTab(Tab) methods.
